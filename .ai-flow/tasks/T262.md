# T262: Update README.md for policies/skills concept

> **Priority**: P2 | **Wave**: 3 | **Track**: F (Generic Format Skills)
> **Depends on**: T261
> **Estimated complexity**: Low

## 1. Objective

Update README.md and docs/*.md to reflect the new folder structure and terminology introduced in T261. Remove verbose lists of built-in items and replace with concise mentions. Document the policies vs skills distinction clearly.

## 2. Changes Required

### 2.1 Remove Detailed Lists

Remove the "Built-in Personas" table (lines 881-898) and replace with:

"Ships with predefined personas (architect, implementer, security-hacker, test-zealot, and more), commands, and hooks for common workflows - ready to use out of the box."

### 2.2 Update Folder Structure Diagrams

Replace all occurrences of rules/ with the new structure. And remove _core.md wherever you find it.

FROM:

```
.ai-tool-sync/
├── config.yaml
├── rules/
│   ├── _core.md
│   └── database.md
├── personas/
├── commands/
└── hooks/
```

TO:

```
.ai-tool-sync/
├── config.yaml
├── policies/           # Constraints - what AI MUST do
│   └── coding-standards.md
├── skills/             # Capabilities - what AI CAN do
│   └── database-guide.md
├── personas/
├── commands/
└── hooks/
```

### 2.3 Add Concepts Section

Add after "Key Features" section:

## Concepts

ai-tool-sync organizes AI instructions into five distinct types:

| Type | Purpose | Loading Strategy |
|------|---------|------------------|
| **Policies** | Constraints the AI MUST follow (coding standards, security rules) | Glob patterns or always_apply |
| **Skills** | Knowledge the AI CAN use (how-to guides, domain expertise) | Semantic matching or explicit |
| **Personas** | Role and personality for the AI to adopt | User selection |
| **Commands** | Actions the user can explicitly invoke | Slash commands |
| **Hooks** | Event-driven interventions (pre-commit, post-edit) | Automatic on events |

### 2.4 Update Frontmatter Examples

Update rule file examples to show new schema.

FROM:

```
---
name: database
description: Database schema and migration guidelines
always_apply: false
globs:
  - "**/*.sql"
---
```

TO:

```
---
name: database-standards
kind: policy
description: Database schema and migration guidelines
loading:
  strategy: glob
  globs:
    - "**/*.sql"
    - "**/migrations/**"
---
```

Add skill example:

```
---
name: database-guide
kind: skill
description: Database design patterns and query optimization
loading:
  strategy: semantic
---
```

### 2.5 Update All Text References

- "rules/" → "policies/" in all file paths
- "Write your rules" → "Write your policies and skills"
- "Rule Files" section header → "Policy Files" (and add "Skill Files" section)
- Remove all _core.md references, use meaningful example names like coding-standards.md
- All config.yaml rule: references → use new terminology

### 2.6 Update config.yaml Examples

FROM:

```
use:
  personas:
    - architect
  commands:
    - lint-fix
```

TO:

```
use:
  personas:
    - architect
  commands:
    - lint-fix
  policies:
    - coding-standards
  skills:
    - database-guide
```

## 3. Files to Modify

- README.md
- docs/CONFIGURATION.md
- docs/LOADERS.md
- docs/GENERATORS.md
- Any other docs/*.md referencing rules/ or listing built-in items
- defaults/rules/authoring-guide.md (align guidance with policies/skills split)

## 4. Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] No detailed lists of built-in personas/commands/hooks remain
- [ ] Brief mention of predefined content exists
- [ ] All rules/ references updated to policies/
- [ ] All _core.md references removed, replaced with meaningful names
- [ ] New skills/ folder documented
- [ ] Concepts section explains the 5 types
- [ ] Frontmatter examples show kind and loading fields
- [ ] All docs/*.md files updated consistently
- [ ] Documentation reads naturally and stays concise

## 5. Out of Scope

- Actual implementation of the folder rename (that's T261)
- Updating code or tests
