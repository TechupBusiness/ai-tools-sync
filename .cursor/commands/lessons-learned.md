## Lessons Learned (REQUIRED)

Before completing: Append lessons to `.ai-flow/learnings.md`

**Trigger**: Any rework—bugs, lint errors, feedback fixes, missed patterns → capture it.

**Format per entry**:
- `[Txxx]` prefix for traceability
- **Problem** → **Solution** structure
- Inline code for specifics
- Impact indicator: 🔴 critical | 🟡 moderate | 🟢 minor

**Restriction:**
- IMPRTANT: Only add non obvious use-ful learnings. Just add nothing if there was no relevant learning.

STOP and write useful learnings before saying "task complete".
