Please start the implementation according to the implementation plan (.ai-flow/tasks/). Run tests & lint without sandbox mode if they fail.

Important context:
- .ai-flow/project.md - Project plan & Architecture
- .ai-flow/learnings.md - Past mistakes

Always update the implementation plan in Txxx.md and mark the checkboxes when tasks are done!!

!! And if there are fixable lint errors, use the --fix option afterwards to fix them (not straight away)!
