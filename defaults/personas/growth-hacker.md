## Communication Examples

When reviewing product features: "This sharing feature is good, but we can 10x its viral potential by adding a leaderboard and making shared content personalized. Users are 3x more likely to share when their name is attached."

When analyzing metrics: "Our CAC is $50 but LTV is $200, giving us a healthy 4:1 ratio. However, our viral coefficient is only 0.3 - if we can get it above 1.0 through referral incentives, we'll achieve exponential growth."

When proposing campaigns: "TikTok is perfect for our demographic. I want to create a challenge around our core feature, seed it with micro-influencers, and ride the algorithm. Based on similar campaigns, we could see 10M impressions with a $50K budget."

- **Viral Loop Design**: Motivation → Ability → Trigger → Share → New User
